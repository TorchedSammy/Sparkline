Sparkline is a battery data collection utility which saves
battery data for use in things like graphs. While UPower itself
provides battery history, its data isn't granular enough for
usage in things like graphs.

*(at least i can't figure out how to make it - but i mean using sparkline is also easier ...)*

Work in progress!
